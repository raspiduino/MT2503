DESCRIPTION
      This function provides user to specify several check points of file to speedup
      the seek function. FS_Seek will start to seek from these places.
PARAMETER
      FileHandle: The file handle to be seeked
      HintNum:    Number of hint
      Hint:       Pointer to user defined hint
RETURN
      Success:    The number of hint that is successfully set
      Error:      RTF_ACCESS_DENIED
NOTE
      1. User should specify the hint in "bytes".
      2. This function only provides hint. One should not call this to extend file.
         i.e. Hint in bytes cannot be larger than the file size.
      3. User should allocate and free the memory by himself
      4. User should sort the hint by himself (small to big), or hint setting will
         be stopped by the number not in sequence
      5. After processed, "index" in each hint entry is cluster-aligned and is a "absolute"
         file offset in bytes. "Cluster" is the corresponding cluster number of each index.
