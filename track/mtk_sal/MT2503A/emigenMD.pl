#* ------------
#*   This script will
#*       1. parse custom_MemoryDevice.h to get memory device type and part number
#*       2. read a excel file to get appropriate emi setting based on the part number
#*       3. based on the emi settings, generate flash_opt.h if not exist
#*       4. based on the emi settings, generate custom_EMI.c if not exist
#*       5. based on the emi settings, generate custom_EMI.h if not exist
#*       6. based on the emi settings, generate custom_flash.c if not exist
#*       7. based on the emi settings, generate custom_flash_norfdm5.c if not exist
